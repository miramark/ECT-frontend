### Report on SDLC (Software Development life cycle)
#### 1- What is SDLC?
- SDLC is a s a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.
#### 2- Stages of the lifecycle:
  ##### a- Planning and requirements analysis
- In this stage, planning and requirement analysis are performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 
- The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.
- ***Panning***
- ***Define project scope***
- ***Set objectives and goals***
- ***Resource Planning***
  ##### b- Defining Requirements
- In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.
- ***Defining***
- ***Functional requirements***
- ***Technical requirements***
- ***Requirements reviews and approved***
  ##### c- Designing Architecture
- SRS (Software Requirements Specifications) is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS).
- This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.
- ***Design***
- ***Low level design***
- ***High level design***
  ##### d- Developing Product
- At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations.
- ***Development***
- ***Coding Standard***
- ***Scalable Code***
- ***Version Control***
- ***Code Review***
  ##### e- Product Testing and Integration
- After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS.
**_Software documentation_** takes place in every stage of the SDLC. A well-written document acts as a tool and means to information repository necessary to know about software processes, functions, how to use the product, and maintenance
- ***System Testing***
- ***Manual testing***
- ***Auotomated testing***
  ##### f- Deployment and Maintenance of Products
- After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision.
- ***Deployment and maintenance***
- ***Release planning***
- ***Deployment automation***
- ***Maintenance***
- ***Feedback***
#### 3-Software Development Life Cycle Models
To this day, we have more than 50 recognized SDLC models in use. But None of them is perfect, and each brings its favourable aspects and disadvantages for a specific software development project or a team.

  ##### a. Waterfall Model
- It is the basis for all other SDLC models. Because of its simple structure, the waterfall model is easier to use and provides a tangible output. In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed, and due to this less flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore. 

  ##### b. Agile Model
- The agile model was mainly designed to adapt to changing requests quickly. The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. The agile model refers to a group of development processes. These processes have some similar characteristics but also possess certain subtle differences among themselves.

  ##### c. Iterative Model
- In the iterative model, each cycle results in a semi-developed but deployable version; with each cycle, some requirements are added to the software, and the final cycle results in the software with the complete requirement specification. 

  ##### d. Spiral Model
- The spiral model provides support for risk handling. It has various spirals in its diagrammatic representation; the number of spirals depends upon the type of project. Each loop in the spiral structure indicates the Phases of the Spiral model.  

  ##### e. V-Shaped Model
- The V-shaped model is executed in a sequential manner in V-shape. Each stage or phase of this model is integrated with a testing phase. After every development phase, a testing phase is associated with it, and the next phase will start once the previous phase is completed, i.e., development & testing. It is also known as the verification or validation model. 

  ##### f. Big Bang Model
- The Big Bang model in SDLC is a term used to describe an informal and unstructured approach to software development, where there is no specific planning, documentation, or well-defined phases.
